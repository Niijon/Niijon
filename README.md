# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Szymon and I come from Poland. Currently I am studying Automation and Robotics at the PoznaÅ„ University of technology.

- ðŸ”­ Currently I am part of students organization that works on building solar cars. These cars are using electric engines and PV panels to use some natural power resources.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently spending my time on learning Electronics and perfecting my skills in programming microcontrollers.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in both electronics so I can learn faster and exploring new ideas
- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m interested in broadly understood technology, science and mathematics. In private I also do many various things such as numerous types of activities and reading books. I am also fond of cooking some delicious food.

# Working Experience 

## Working in company
<p align="left"> <a href="https://www.forcom.com.pl/pl/home/" target="_blank"> <img src="https://logos.gpcdn.pl/loga-firm/18797771/03000000-bb2f-3863-31e8-08d8e893f742_280x280.png" alt="Forcom" width="50" height="50"/> </a> </p>
In 2021 I have been working for Forcom organization as a C# programmer. I also used both .NET and SQL as well as worked with some APIs mainly using REST. Gained a lot of experience while spending my time there thanks to my great superiors.

At the moment I am working for GOONLINE company. I am currently leader of small team and we are working on both hardware and software for drones. 


## PUT Solar Dynamics organization
I am also working on couple of projects as a member of PUT SOLAR DYNAMICS organization. I have been responsible for carring out ECM project that has been fully implemented as main controller inside of CAN communication iterface of the car. I also have been a part of MPPT project and currently I am also working on Dashboard project as well as new Telemetry project that is going to be implemented in new car.

Aside from programming experience I also am responsible for project management because I am one of the leaders in PUT Solar Dynamics organization so I spent a lot of time in means to implement new solutions and solve problems. 

## University projects
As a student I also have gathered some experience in Electronics because I have made twilight sensor and sensor for detecting cables. I worked on image processing project that has been a part of my Digital Technologies subject inside of which we simply used logic gates and other components inside of logisim to make desired image on the output. I have experience in working with matlab and python for simulation of dynamic systems and as for python I also have been working with it for some data science. I also have done a couple of C++ project for my studies in one of which I had implemented A* algorithm inside of the OpenGL rendered game. I also have had experience with machine learning using python, Android app development using Android studio, as well as PLC programming using various methods(ladder, FBD, ST).
